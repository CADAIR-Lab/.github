# CADAIR: Cheikh Anta Diop Artificial Intelligence Research lab
Building the foundations of low-resource AI for better fairness and inclusivity.

# Description
Initial work is focused on NLP with Senegalese languages.

> Working groups will be established according to the topics developed.

# Research Directions
Below is a domain list to explore, it will be expanded as we go along:
* Iterative data collection approach suitable for the african context
* Tokenization and vocabulary representations in Transformers
* [Zero]Few-shot [Multilingual] Transfer
* Efficient training mechanisms
* Distillation and Pruning
* Model Quantization
* More efficient Pre-Training objectives
    - [ELECTRA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10555.pdf)
* [Data-Centric AI](https://datacentricai.org/)
* [Adapters](https://adapterhub.ml/) & Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
