# CADAIR: Cheikh Anta Diop Artificial Intelligence Research Lab
CADAIR AI Lab is a research and innovation hub dedicated to rethinking how AI is built, trained, and deployed for low-resource and multilingual settings, with a particular focus on African languages and contexts. We combine deep technical research with practical ecosystem building, **bridging the gap between frontier AI science and local applicability**.

Our vision is to **build the foundations of low-resource Artificial Intelligence that advances fairness, inclusivity, and linguistic equity across Africa**. We envision a future where every community; regardless of language, connectivity, or data availability; can access powerful AI systems that understand their culture, context, and voice.

# Research Directions
Our research targets the core foundations of low-resource AI, spanning the entire data-to-model pipeline. We design efficient, adaptive, and culturally aligned AI systems by focusing on the following pillars:
* Iterative data collection approach suitable for the African context
* Data-Centric AI
* Tokenization and vocabulary representations in Transformers
* [Zero] Few-shot [Multilingual] Transfer
* Efficient training mechanisms
* Distillation and Pruning
* Model Quantization
* Efficient Pre-Training objectives
* Adapters & Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
