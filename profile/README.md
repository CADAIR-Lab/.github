# CADAIR: Cheikh Anta Diop Artificial Intelligence Research Lab
Building the foundations of low-resource AI for better fairness and inclusivity in Africa.

# Description
Initial work is focused on NLP with Senegalese languages.

> Working groups will be established according to the topics developed.

# Research Directions
Below is a domain list to explore, it will be expanded as we go along:
* Iterative data collection approach suitable for the African context
* Data-Centric AI
* Tokenization and vocabulary representations in Transformers
* [Zero] Few-shot [Multilingual] Transfer
* Efficient training mechanisms
* Distillation and Pruning
* Model Quantization
* Efficient Pre-Training objectives
* Adapters & Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
