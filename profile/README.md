# CADAIR: Cheikh Anta Diop Artificial Intelligence Research Lab
At CADAIR AI Lab, we believe that the next leap in Artificial Intelligence will emerge from **connecting frontier science with local meaning**. Our work reimagines how state-of-the-art AI methods can be re-engineered to solve Africa’s most tangible challenges. Our team conducts applied AI research that bridges the gap between advanced machine learning theory and real-world implementation in Africa to ensure that the progress of AI becomes a shared language of empowerment.

Our vision is to **build the foundations of low-resource Artificial Intelligence that advances fairness, inclusivity, and linguistic equity across Africa**. We envision a future where every community; regardless of language, connectivity, or data availability; can access powerful AI systems that understand their culture, context, and voice.

# Research Directions
Our research targets the core foundations of low-resource AI, spanning the entire data-to-model pipeline. We design efficient, adaptive, and culturally aligned AI systems by focusing on the following pillars:
* Iterative data collection approach suitable for the African context
* Data-Centric AI
* Tokenization and vocabulary representations in Transformers
* [Zero] Few-shot [Multilingual] Transfer
* Efficient training mechanisms
* Distillation and Pruning
* Model Quantization
* Efficient Pre-Training objectives
* Adapters & Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
